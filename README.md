# Intro to Shiny
###### 2022-05-15
The repo was prepared for Intro to Shiny workshops for R User Group Philippines.

## Goal
The goal of the workshops is to show the basics of Shiny. We won't go into the details of how to write Shiny code, instead I will show you some concepts and elements of Shiny that were a game changers for me when I was starting building the Shiny apps.

## How to use the repo
There are 6 apps, each of them explaining a new concept. App 01 is the most simple one, and each further app extends the previous one, so it's worth exploring them in that sequence

### Prerequisites
You need two libraries to run the repo

```{r}
install.packages("shiny")
install.packages("ggplot2")
```
